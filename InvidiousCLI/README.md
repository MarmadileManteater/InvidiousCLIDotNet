# Invidious CLI Plugin Library

This is a library for creating plugins for InvidiousCLIDotNet. InvidiousCLIDotNet is a command line interface which allows you to easily interface with the [Invidious](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious) API from the command line. This project depends on [InvidiousClientDotNet](https://github.com/MarmadileManteater/InvidiousClientDotNet) to make the API calls.
